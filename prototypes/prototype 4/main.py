"""
PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTING WIRE CONNECTIVITY:

1. If dragging wire, and mouse button is released, add all collided socket sprites to a list.
2. For the first sprite in the list, labelled endSocket, instantiate an instance of the Wire class 
with the start and end coordinates as startSockets, endSockets rect.x,y values respectively.
3. Add the new instance to a sprite group containing all wires.
4. Draw all of the final connected wires once every game loop.


MANAGING CONDITIONS FOR WIRE CONNECTIVITY AND INVALID CONNECTIONS
This will make sure that wires do not come out of a socket and connect to the same socket, 
a socket of the same component, or a socket that already has a wire connected to it.
